Dragon
======

This folder contains a general purpose library of compiler construction tools in Scala. The
name of this library is a tribute to the famous compiler design text commonly called the "dragon
book." However this library does not implement only the algorithms described in that book. Any
code generally useful for compiler construction is a suitable to Dragon.
