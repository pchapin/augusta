  <title>Dragon Design</title>

  <para>Dragon is a library of general purpose components written in Scala that are useful to
    compiler construction. The Dragon library is used by both the main Augusta compiler and by
    the experimental Tiger compiler. However, Dragon is independent in the sense that it has no
    formal dependency on either of the compiler projects; it could be used in other, unrelated
    projects. As a result Dragon is documented in distinct sections of this document.
    Potentially the Dragon documentation could be separated into its own document.</para>
