Tiger
=====

This folder contains an implementation of the Tiger language as described in "Modern Compiler
Implementation in ML," (known as MCIML throughout this code base) by Andrew W. Appel (Cambridge
University Press, (C) 1998, ISBN=0-521- 60764-7). It also contains solutions to some of the
exercises in the book.

The purpose of this project is to explore the use of Scala as a compiler implementation
language. Specifically I want to experiment with Scala's somewhat unique combination of object
oriented and functional features in the context of compiler construction. I also want to
experiment with Scala's support for parallel programming to see if a compiler can be made that
takes good advantage of that support.

My intention is to transfer what I learn from implementing Tiger in Scala to the main Augusta
project. Although the materials here try to be faithful to MCIML, I have taken liberties with
certain things for the sake of my larger goals.
