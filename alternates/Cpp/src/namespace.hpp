 * \namespace wac
 *  
 * This name space contains general purpose entities that are used by the other compiler name
 * spaces. Members of this name space are either shared by many components or can't be well
 * classified into any of the other name spaces that are defined.
 *  
 * Periodically the contents of name space wac should be reviewed to see if any of its members
 * should be moved to another name space or grouped into a new name space.

/*!
 * \namespace scanner
 *  
 * This name space contains all the entities related to lexical analysis. Specifically it covers
 * the handling of the source files and the process of breaking the input text into tokens.
