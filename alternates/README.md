# README

This folder contains two alternate implementations of the AGC compiler. One is a C++
implementation, and the other is a Rust implementation. The subfolders that contain these
implementations are currently configured as stand-alone projects with their own `.vscode`
settings, etc. This is because we assume people developing these alternate implementations will
not be inclined to configure an entire Scala environment and thus have only passing interest in
the requirements of the main implementation in Scala.

See the README files in the subfolders for more information.
