# AGC (An Augusta Compiler in Rust)

This project is intended to be an Augusta compiler written in Rust. The name, AGC is pronounced
"Agency." Although this is the same name as the main August compiler in Scala, there are
significant differences between the two compilers.

## Building

Building AGC is supported on all systems where Rust is supported. To build the compiler in debug
mode, use the command:

    $ cargo build
