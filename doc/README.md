README
======

This folder contains the main Augusta documentation set. It is only a placeholder right now.

The Augusta documentation is written using reStructuredText (reST) and compiled with Sphinx into
presentation formats. Information about how to set up and configure the documentation build
system will appear in this file at a later time.

See the README files in the subfolders for more information about the contents of those
subfolders.
