Tutorial
========

This folder contains the tutorial. It describes how to use Augusta to build simple programs. It
also describes the basics of the Augusta Language. For more information on the subset of Ada
currently supported by Augusta, see the Reference Manual.

This tutorial assumes you are already familiar with the basics of programming and how to use the
command line on your system. This is not a programming tutorial. However, this tutorial does not
assume any prior knowledge of Ada.
