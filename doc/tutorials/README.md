Tutorials
=========

This folder contains two tutorials. One on Scala for Ada programmers (Ada2Scala) and the other
on Ada for Scala programmers (Scala2Ada). Since Augusta might be of interest to potential
contributors from both communities, it seemed like a good idea to provide tutorials that would
be relevant for either group. For example, an Ada person who wants to contribute to Augusta
might need to learn some Scala. In contrast, a Scala person who wants to contribute might need
to learn some Ada.

The tutorials here assume reasonable fluency in the "source" language and focus on the
techniques and technologies used by Augusta. However they are intended to be general and could
also be of interest to a wider audience. Furthermore, a reader does not have to know the exact
source language of each tutorial to benefit from them. For example a reader fluent with C++ but
not Ada could still read the Ada2Scala tutorial to learn the basics of Scala. Similarly a Java
programmer interested in learning Ada could benefit from the Scala2Ada tutorial as well.
