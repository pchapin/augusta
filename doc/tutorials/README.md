Tutorials
=========

This folder contains two tutorials. One on Scala for Ada programmers (Ada2Scala) and the other
on Ada for Scala programmers (Scala2Ada). Since Augusta might be of interest to programmers from
both communities it seemed like a good idea to provide tutorials that would be relevant to both
communities. For example an Ada person who wants to contribute to Augusta might need to learn
Scala. In contrast a Scala person who wants to contribute might need to learn Ada.

The tutorials here assume reasonable fluency in the "source" language and focus on the
techniques and technologies used by Augusta. However they are intended to be reasonably general
and could be of interest to a wider audience as well. Furthermore a reader does not have to know
the exact source language of each tutorial to benefit from them. For example a reader fluent
with C++ but not Ada could still read the Ada2Scala tutorial to learn the basics of Scala. The
Ada code in that tutorial will probably be readable enough and the general orientation of the
document should be compatible with a C++ programmer's world view. Similarly a Java programmer
interested in learning Ada could benefit from the Scala2Ada tutorial as well.

The tutorials are written in DocBook v5. They should be readable in a text editor but a DocBook
tool chain would be necessary to generate HTML or PDF from the tutorial source.
