# Ada Tutorial

This folder is a placeholder for a tutorial on the Ada programming language. It is intended to
support members of the Scala community who are interested in contributing to Augusta, but who
don't know Ada. The [Augusta Wiki](https://github.com/pchapin/augusta/wiki) also contains links
to various Ada resources that might be of interest to Augusta/AGC developers.

One of us (Peter Chapin) has written a general-purpose [Ada
Tutorial](https://www.pchapin.org/Ada/AdaCrash.pdf) that you might find useful. The [GitHub
repository for that tutorial](https://github.com/pchapin/tutorialada) contains its source
documents and sample code.
