# README

This folder contains a collection of Scala presentations that one of us (pchapin) used when
teaching the programming languages course at Vermont State University (formerly Vermont
Technical College) using Scala.

The presentations are in need of updating to make them suitable for self-study. For example,
they were created originally for Scala 2.x and reflect the syntax and best practices of an
earlier era.
