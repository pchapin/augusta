Open Watcom Ada Compiler
========================

This is the beginnings of the Open Watcom Ada compiler. See the design documentation in the
'doc' folder for more details about this project, its goals, and its organization.

This project is currently independent of Augusta but I include it here because it has similiar
overall goals (the construction of a useful open source Ada compiler). Wac is written in C++ and
is intended to use the Open Watcom back-end so it is unlikely that it will share much code with
Augusta itself. Furthermore this subproject is not being currently pursued. Nevertheless I
wanted to keep my Ada compiler efforts together. Who knows how things will unfold in the future!
